********************** RESERVE BANK OF INDIA   ************************

--Nidhi Companies in India are regulated primarily by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) under the Government of India. While they fall under the broad category of Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), they are not regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) like other NBFCs.



Banks are also required to maintain a portion of their demand and time liabilities as cash reserves with the Reserve Bank. For this purpose, they need to maintain current account with the Reserve Bank. The current account of the banks is opened by the Banking Departments of the Reserve Bank’s Regional offices. The Department of Government and Bank Accounts (DGBA) issues general guidelines for opening the current accounts.

-- Presently, the Reserve Bank has appointed 12 public sector banks, 20 private sector banks and 01 foreign sector bank (WOS) as its agency banks for conducting Government banking business

-- The Monetary Policy Committee is required to meet at least four times in a year. The quorum for the meeting of the MPC is four members(total members 6).

*  how is local area bank different from Urban Cooperative Bank?
Local Area Banks (LABs):v

tehy are small, privately owned banks.
They operate as for-profit entities with a limited geographic scope, typically covering three contiguous districts.

Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs):

UCBs are cooperative institutions that are owned by their members, who are also their customers.
They operate on a cooperative model, where each member has a vote regardless of the number of shares owned, reflecting the "one member, one vote" principle.

* Difference between scheduled and Un-scheduled banks?

  both scheduled and unscheduled bank are subject to banking regulations act 1949.
  Scheduled banks have access to various low credit facilities from RBI(Like MSF) for their normal banking requirements.
  UnScheduled banks are not entittled to  borrow from RBI for normal banking requirements except for abnormal circumstances.


* What is NEER and REER? with analogy

Imagine you're comparing the prices of oranges from different stalls in a market. Each stall represents a different country, and the price at each stall is how much your local currency (like dollars) can buy.

NEER is like calculating the average price of oranges across all stalls, but with a twist. You give more importance (or weight) to the stalls where you buy oranges more often. This gives you an idea of how strong your currency is compared to others, on average, but only considering the face value of the prices.

REER (Real Effective Exchange Rate):
Now, think about how the quality or size of the oranges might differ between stalls. Some stalls might offer bigger, juicier oranges for the same price, while others might have smaller ones.

REER is like adjusting the average price you calculated in NEER by also considering these differences in quality. In economic terms, it adjusts for things like inflation in each country. So, REER gives you a better sense of the real value of your currency, taking into account how much you can actually buy in different countries after considering the cost of living or inflation there.


--- The Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU) is the unemployment rate at which inflation remains stable. It's the lowest rate of unemployment that can be sustained without causing inflation and wage growth to increase. 

***what is reflation and disinflation?
  Reflation and disinflation** are terms used to describe different economic processes related to inflation.

### 1. **Reflation**
- **Definition**: Reflation refers to the deliberate attempt by policymakers, such as central banks or governments, to stimulate the economy by increasing inflation to a healthier or desired level, typically after a period of deflation or economic downturn.

- **Purpose**: The goal of reflation is to increase economic activity, raise prices to a sustainable level, and avoid deflation (falling prices), which can harm economic growth. Measures used include lowering interest rates, increasing government spending, or expanding the money supply.

- **Example**: After a recession, governments might try to boost demand and employment through reflationary policies like tax cuts or increased public spending, which, in turn, can help raise inflation rates to normal levels.

### 2. **Disinflation**
 
    Definition**: Disinflation refers to a slowdown in the rate of inflation. It means that prices are still increasing, but at a slower rate than before.
    Difference from Deflation**: Unlike deflation (where prices are actually falling), disinflation means that prices are still rising, but the pace of the increase is declining.
- **Purpose**: Disinflation is often a desired outcome when inflation is too high and policymakers, such as central banks, aim to bring it down to a more stable or target rate. Central banks may use interest rate hikes or reduce the money supply to achieve this.
- **Example**: If inflation drops from 5% to 3%, this is disinflation. Prices are still rising, but more slowly.

In summary, **reflation** is about increasing inflation after a period of low inflation or deflation, while **disinflation** is about reducing the rate of inflation without causing deflation.


*** What is FPO in share market?

   - **Market**: Sold at a discount to face value in money markets.
   - **Usage**: Typically used by large, well-established firms with high credit ratings.

### 2. **Commercial Bill**:
   - Nature**: A bill of exchange, or a negotiable instrument, drawn by a seller on a buyer for payment at a future date.
   - Issuer**: Typically issued by businesses involved in trade , banks,aifi,nbfc,mutual funds.
   - Maturity**: Usually between 30 days and 180 days.
   - Purpose**: Used in trade finance to facilitate commercial transactions (e.g., when a seller wants payment at a future date).
   - Security**: Can be secured by underlying goods in trade transactions.
   - Market**: Can be discounted by banks (i.e., sold before maturity at a discount) to get immediate cash.
   - **Usage**: Common in trade and commerce, especially for credit-based transactions.
   - **Risk**: Lower risk if secured by goods; however, the buyer’s creditworthiness plays a role in the bill's acceptance.

### Summary:

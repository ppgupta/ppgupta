project related information-- BFCMS- bank fraud case management system, we used to receive XAMS Message from mq as a input and we needed to process that xams messages through API and publish that case and store values of xams in relevant table

//

Optional Return Type  -- it is useful to avoid null pointer exception

A container object which can store null values as well as non null values , if value is present it will  return True , Optional.IsPresent()-- true , and we can get its value by  optional.get() if value is not present then "NoSuchElementFoundException" occurs
Optional.Empty()


StringUtils.isBlank()-- java 11 feature

String.format(this is my %s for %s in %s,"book","PP","")

StringUtils.hasText()

      restTemplate.postForObject(createPersonUrl, request, String.class);

EmployeeList response = restTemplate.getForObject(
  "http://localhost:8080/employees",
  EmployeeList.class);
List<Employee> employees = response.getEmployees();


EmployeeList response = restTemplate.postForObject(
  "http://localhost:8080/employees",
  EmployeeList.class);


used openshift container for deployment of the application
//

method of deploying an app on pcf

set proxy

cf login -a ______________Api link

select organization and space
cf push
after that set enviroment variable from any running instances of that app
change the app name by going into the setting
add relevent services bu going inside working instances of that app


we are doing virtualization , mocking of downstream services to do test autoscaling by scaling up , autoscaling means increasing or decreasing resources on basis of number of request we are getting per second.

steps to do virtualization-

firstly changes the endpoint in .yml file whichever downstream service i want to mock


there is data type called as UUID 
A universally unique identifier (UUID) is a 128-bit number used to identify information in computer systems.
 You can create a UUID and use it to uniquely identify something. In its canonical textual representation, the 16 octets of a UUID are 
represented as 32 hexadecimal (base-16) digits, displayed in five groups separated by hyphens, in the form 8-4-4-4-12 for a total of 36 characters
 (32 hexadecimal characters and 4 hyphens). For example, a81bc81b-dead-4e5d-abff-90865d1e13b1.

In Oracle NoSQL, UUID values are represented by the UUID data type. The UUID data type is considered a subtype of the STRING data type,
 because UUID values are displayed in their canonical textual format and, in general, behave the same as string values in the various SQL operators 
and expressions. However, in order to save disk space, the UUID value is saved in a compact format on disk. 
If the UUID value is the primary key, the canonical 36-byte string is converted to a 19-byte string, then is saved on disk. 
If the UUID value is a non-primary key, the canonical 36-byte string is converted to a 16-byte array, then is saved on disk.

A table column can be declared as having UUID type in a CREATE TABLE statement. 
The UUID data type is best-suited in situations where you need a globally unique identifier for the records in a table that span multiple regions
 since identity columns are only guaranteed to be unique within a NoSQL cluster in a region.

** Junit test cases , wiremock for the api

mockito for mocking any services

// How to deploy application in ocp locally


 we can also deploy in ocp using jenkins pipeline by runnin scripts

we can deplot it locally using ocp cli
